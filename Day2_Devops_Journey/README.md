## The Café Crew 👩‍🍳👨‍💼👮

- **HTTPD** – The chef who serves web pages 🍽️  
- **SystemCTL** – The manager who keeps the chef working efficiently 👨‍💼  
- **AWS Security Groups** – The bouncers guarding the doors so only the right guests enter 👮  
- **Domain Mapping** – The café’s signboard so visitors can find it easily 🏷️

## My First Server Café 🌥️

By the end of the day, I had **set up my very first little server café in the cloud**. I could see how the components work together to serve content safely and reliably.

Feeling excited to see what **Day 3** has in store on this DevOps adventure! 🚀

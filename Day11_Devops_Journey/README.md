# Day 11: File Viewing & Inspection in Linux 🖥️

🚀 **Learn from doing** — today I focused on exploring essential commands for **file viewing and inspection**, especially useful for real-world **log monitoring** and **debugging**.  

---

## 🔹 Commands I Practiced

- **`cat`, `less`, `more`** → Different ways to view files  
- **`head`, `tail -f`** → Preview file start/end & monitor logs live  
- **`nl`, `tac`** → Numbering and reversing file content  
- **`wc`, `file`, `stat`** → Analyzing file size, type & metadata  

---

## 📂 Task of the Day

- Created a sample `app.log` file  
- Appended new entries into it  
- Monitored it live with **`tail -f`**  

This gave me a real taste of how **logs are tracked in production environments**.  

---

## ✨ Key Takeaway

File inspection is a **must-have skill** for troubleshooting, debugging, and monitoring systems. Mastering these commands builds confidence for real-world DevOps scenarios.

📅 I’ll continue this **daily Linux practice until 30th September** to reach an **intermediate level in Linux** 💪

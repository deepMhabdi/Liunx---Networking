# Day 14: File Compression & Archiving 📦

🚀 **Learn from doing** — today I explored how Linux handles **backups, packaging, and compression** like a pro.  

---

## 🖥️ Archiving & Compression Tools  

- **`tar`** → Create and extract archives  
- **`gzip` / `gunzip`** → Fast compression & decompression  
- **`bzip2` / `bunzip2`** → Better compression, slower speed  
- **`zip` / `unzip`** → Popular cross-platform format  

---

## 📂 Task of the Day  

- Created a **backup archive** of my practice folder using `tar`  
- Compressed and decompressed log files with `gzip`  
- Experimented with `zip` for multiple files  

💡 It felt like doing **Linux-level packaging 📦** before shipping something important.

## ✨ Key Takeaway  

Archiving and compression are not just about saving space — they are **essential for backups and deployments** in DevOps.

# Day 3: Running a Linux School 🏫

Day 3 of my **DevOps journey** felt like setting up my very own Linux school!  

---

## Hiring Teachers & Starting Classes 👩‍🏫🔔

- **`sudo dnf install httpd -y`** – Hired a new teacher (installed the web server)  
- **`sudo systemctl start httpd`** – Rang the bell to begin the class 🔔  
- **`sudo systemctl enable httpd`** – Made sure the teacher comes every day without me calling  
- **`sudo systemctl status httpd`** – Checking if the teacher is actually in the classroom or skipping 😅

## Fun Shell Commands for School Life 🛠️

- **`echo`** – Made the teacher repeat after me 🗣️  
- **`date`** – Told me what day it is so I don’t miss recess 📅  
- **`mkdir`** – Helped me create new classrooms 🏠  
- **`ls`** – Let me peek into cupboards to see what books are inside 📚

Day 3 was me being the **new principal of a Linux school**, setting routines, checking attendance, and building new classrooms 🚀  

Excited to see how my DevOps adventure continues! 🌟

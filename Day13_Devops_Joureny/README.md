## 🖥️ File Search Tools  

- **`find`** → Locate files by name, type, or size  
- **`which`** → Find where a command binary lives  
- **`whereis`** → Get binary, man page, and source location  
- **`type`** → Check if a command is alias, built-in, or binary

## 📂 Task of the Day  

- Located all `.log` files in my practice folder  
- Found files larger than **1MB** inside `/var/log`  
- Compared how `which`, `whereis`, and `type` behave differently  

💡 Felt like being a **Linux detective with a magnifying glass** 🕵️

## ✨ Key Takeaway  

Linux gives **multiple ways to search**, but `find` is the **real powerhouse** when it comes to flexibility and accuracy.

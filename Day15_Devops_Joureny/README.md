# Day 7: User & Permission Management 👤🔑

🚀 **Learn from doing** — today was all about **security and access control** in Linux.  

---

## 🖥️ User & Permission Tools  

- **`id`, `groups`** → Who am I and what groups do I belong to?  
- **`who`, `w`** → See who’s logged in and what they’re doing  
- **`chmod`** → Change file permissions (read/write/execute)  
- **`chown`** → Change file ownership  
- **`umask`** → Default permission mask  

---

## 📂 Task of the Day  

- Checked my user and group details with `id`  
- Played around with file permissions using `chmod` (like `755` vs `644`)  
- Changed ownership of test files using `chown`  
- Verified everything with `ls -l`  

💡 It felt like holding the **keys to the Linux house 🔑**, deciding who can enter which room.

## ✨ Key Takeaway  

Permissions and ownership are the **foundation of Linux security** — mastering them ensures a safe and well-structured system.

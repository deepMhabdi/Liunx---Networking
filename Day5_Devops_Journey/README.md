# Day 5: Reflection & Building Foundations 💡

These last 5 days of my **DevOps journey** have been extra special, following a 4-month roadmap by **TrainWithShubham**. It’s not just about daily tasks, but building a strong foundation **day by day**.

## Highlights from Day 5 📝

- Attended a **live session** with Shubham Sir and gained deeper insights into the **pillars of DevOps**:  
  - Scaling  
  - Monitoring  
  - Infrastructure  
  - Automation  
- Continued practicing **essential Linux commands** because muscle memory matters in the terminal.  
- From tomorrow, I’ll be diving into **Networking concepts**, while keeping my Linux practice consistent.

## Key Takeaway 📈

DevOps isn’t just about tools; it’s about **mindset, discipline, and continuous learning**.  

Excited for the next phase of this journey! 🚀

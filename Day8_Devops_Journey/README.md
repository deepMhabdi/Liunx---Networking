# Day 8: Networking & AWS VPC 🌐🏡

Today’s focus was on **Networking** and **AWS VPC**. I created notes (Hindi + English mix) from **TrainWithShubham** lecture, which made the concepts crystal clear.

## 🔑 Key Learnings

- **IPv4 vs IPv6** → Understanding the difference and why we need unlimited addresses.  
- **Subnetting** → Breaking a big network into smaller, manageable networks.  
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** → Creating your own private space inside the cloud.  
- **Ubuntu Server Setup** → Installed **Nginx**, managed firewall/security groups for **SSH** & **HTTP**.  
- **Public IPs** → Assigning and testing connectivity.

## 💡 Real-Life Example

Think of **VPC** like a **gated society 🏡** inside a big city:  

- The **city** = the internet  
- Inside your **society (VPC)**, you decide:  
  - Who can enter (**security groups**)  
  - Where people can go (**subnets**)  
  - How they connect to the outside world (**public IP**)  

Each day makes me feel more confident about **building scalable and secure infrastructure**.

# Day 17: Disk Usage & Monitoring 💾

🚀 **Learn from doing** — today I learned how to keep an eye on **system resources** like disk and memory.  

---

## 🖥️ Monitoring Tools  

- **`df -h`** → Disk usage  
- **`du -sh *`** → Folder sizes  
- **`free -h`** → Memory usage  
- **`uptime`** → System load & uptime  
- **`vmstat`, `iostat`** → Detailed CPU, disk, and memory stats  

---

## 📂 Task of the Day  

- Checked disk usage with `df -h`  
- Found largest folders in `~/practice` using `du -sh *`  
- Monitored memory usage with `free -h`  
- Observed system load with `uptime`  

💡 It felt like doing a **health check-up 🩺** for the Linux system.

## ✨ Key Takeaway  

Disk and memory monitoring are **vital for performance tuning and preventing system crashes**.

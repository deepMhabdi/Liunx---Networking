# Day 4: Shell Scripting & User Management in Linux 🚀

Day 4 of my **DevOps journey** was all about **Shell Scripting** and **User Management** in Linux.  

---

## Key Takeaways ✅

### File Extensions
- Just like Python files have `.py` and text files have `.txt`, shell scripts use the `.sh` extension.  

### Shell Scripting Basics 🛠️
- Gave execution permission using `chmod +x`  
- Wrote and executed shell scripts using commands like `echo`, `pwd`, `date`, `free -h`  
- Created scripts to take input from users with `read`  

### User Management in Linux 👥
- Created new users with `useradd`  
- Set and updated passwords with `passwd`  
- Switched users using `su`  
- Verified users with `whoami` and checked home directories

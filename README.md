# 🚀 My DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my DevOps journey!  
This repository documents everything I learn and practice each day as I work towards becoming a **DevOps Engineer** and mastering industry-relevant skills.

## 📌 About This Journey
The goal of this journey is to:
- Build a **solid foundation in DevOps** concepts.
- Learn **Linux, Networking, Git, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, and more**.
- Showcase my **daily progress publicly** for consistency and accountability.
- Create a **portfolio of practical learnings & mini-projects** that recruiters can see.

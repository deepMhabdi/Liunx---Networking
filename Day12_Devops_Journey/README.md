# Day 12: Text Search, Regex & Networking Fundamentals 🕵️🌍

🚀 **Learn from doing** — today I explored the **detective tools of Linux** that help in searching, filtering, and manipulating text like a pro. Alongside, I brushed up on some **networking fundamentals**.

## 🖥️ Text Search & Regex (Regular Expressions)

- **`grep`, `egrep`** → Finding patterns inside files  
- **`cut`, `tr`** → Extracting and transforming data  
- **`sort`, `uniq`** → Organizing and counting unique entries  
- **`awk`, `sed`** → Text-processing powerhouses for reports and replacements

## 📂 Task of the Day

- Analyzed a sample `system.log`  
- Filtered only **ERROR** and **WARNING**  
- Counted how many times they appeared  
- Replaced all **ERROR** with **CRITICAL**  

💡 It felt like doing **“log surgery” 🩺**.

## 🌐 Bonus Learning — Networking Fundamentals

- **DNS** → The internet’s phonebook, turning `google.com` into an IP.  
- **NAT** → A translator at a party, helping private IPs talk to the outside world.  
- **ping** → The friendly *“hello, are you there?”* message for connectivity.  
- **traceroute** → Google Maps for packets, showing every hop along the way.  
- **nslookup** → Asking the DNS phonebook directly for a number.

## ✨ Key Takeaway

- **Text tools** make you a **log detective** 🕵️  
- **Networking tools** make you a **packet traveler** 🌍  

Both are **core DevOps skills** I’ll keep building on!
